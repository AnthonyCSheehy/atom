Built with AngularJS!

Dependencies (tested in Ubuntu 12.04):

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs build-essential # Yep, you're going to need make, gcc, etc...
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

Build instructions (in /plugins/arDrmcPlugin/frontend):

$ npm install
$ grunt build
$ php symfony cc # In root directory

You can run "grunt watch" to detect changes during development and trigger the build.
Take into account that "grunt build" will be still necessary to be executed once when
you are configuring a new environment or the vendor browserify build has changed. See
Gruntfile.js for more details.
